1 Welcome to the OJS Lucene/Solr Plug-In!
-----------------------------------------

This README file contains important information with respect to the correct and
secure installation of the OJS Lucene/Solr plug-in. Please make sure you read it
in full before enabling the plug-in.

While most of the code of this plug-in is published under the usual OJS license
terms, some configuration file code is based on files from the Solr and Jetty
distributions. These projects are governed by the Apache License 2.0. We
therefore included a copy of this license in the root directory of this plug-in,
see LICENSE-APACHE-2.0.txt.

For more details please visit the Solr web site:
- <https://lucene.apache.org/solr/>


2 Should I use the Lucene/Solr Plug-In?
---------------------------------------

The first decision to take is whether to use the plug-in at all. The main
advantages of the plug-in's search implementation over the default OJS search
are:

- Support for multi-lingual search. The plug-in provides language-aware
  stemming of search phrases. You can define language-specific stopword and
  synonym lists. And languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean will be
  supported.

- Additional search features: The plug-in provides additional search features
  like result set ordering and improved ranking. You'll also be able to use all
  features of the Lucene query parser, see the Lucene documentation for details.

- Faster indexing: The plug-in uses the Tika document parser in the background
  which is extremely fast. You'll recognize the difference when adding galleys
  to an article or when having to rebuild the index.

- Additional document formats: The Tika document parser is able to convert a
  large number of documents. Most notably it supports ePub format which is not
  otherwise supported by the default OJS search implementation. You'll find a
  current list of all supported document formats on the Tika website.

Caution: The default OJS search installation supports parsing of PostScript
documents. If you have articles that contain information in PostScript documents
and you do not use any alternative galley format that can be understood by Tika
then please do not use this plug-in. Tika is not able to parse PostScript
documents.


3 Decisions to take before enabling the Plug-In
-----------------------------------------------

This plug-in is an adapter between OJS and the Solr search server. It requires a
working Solr server somewhere on your network.

You should have a basic understanding of how the Solr search server works before
taking a deployment decision. It is in no way necessary to understand Solr
internals but it would be useful to understand Solr's basic architecture and
how it interoperates with applications.

This plug-in can be deployed in two quite different ways:
1) with an embedded Solr server
2) with a remote Solr server

Independently of the deployment scenario, you can choose from two index update
modes:
1) push processing: OJS will push all article changes to the Solr server
2) pull processing: The Solr server will request article changes in regular
   intervals.

The following sections will help you to take the right decisions with respect
to these configuration alternatives.


4 Embedded versus Remote Server Mode
------------------------------------

In embedded server mode, the Solr search server will run on the same server as
OJS itself. If you have only a single OJS installation on your server then
embedded server mode is almost certainly what you want. It will be very easy to
install and configure and you don't have to worry about any Solr configuration
as we provide a default configuration that should work for you unchanged.

If you have multiple OJS installations on a single server then you still
may run in embedded server mode but please make sure that you only start a
single embedded Solr instance per server. To do so you should choose one of your
OJS installations and always run the start/stop scripts (see below) from just
that installation. If you follow the installation procedure for the embedded
server below for just one installation then you're on the right track.

If you are a larger OJS provider and you have many OJS installations on one or
several servers then central server mode is probably better suited to your
needs. In central server mode you'll be able to install a single Solr instance
somewhere on your network and use it for all your OJS installations. This will
make your deployment much easier to monitor and administer.

If you deploy in central server mode then you'll have to understand Solr a bit
better. You'll have to be able to install a running Solr instance with one or
more cores on your own. You can still use our Solr schema.xml and data import
configuration file unchanged and you'll probably have to make minimal or no
changes to our default solrconfig.xml and solr.xml configuration files. But you
should be able to understand the solrconfig.xml and solr.xml and check whether
it suits your specific needs. You should also be able to set up a firewall and
write a web server configuration as Solr itself comes with no security checks at
all.

If you deploy in central server mode you'll also have to decide which journals
you want to collocate. You have to keep in mind that you only can search across
OJS installations if you collocate articles from various installations in one
core. On the other hand you should not collocate documents from various
installations if you don't want to search across these documents. Collocating
documents can have negative effects on ranking and may require additional
maintenance effort (e.g. when having to rebuild an index from scratch after
some Solr server downtime, etc.). So please make sure you know which OJS
installations should be bundled in which core before you start deploying your
Solr server.

As a final preliminary step you'll have to make sure that your server meets the
necessary installation requirements to install Solr. This is the OJS server if
you decide to deploy in embedded server mode or the central search server if you
deploy in central server mode:

- Operating System: Any operating system that supports J2SE 1.8 or greater
  (this includes all recent versions of Linux and Windows).

- Disk Space: The disk your Solr server will reside on should have at least
  150 MB of free disk space for the Solr/Jetty installation files. The disc your
  index will reside on should have enough free disk to accommodate at least
  twice the space occupied by all your galleys and supplementary files in the
  files folders of your OJS installations. In embedded mode the index will be
  installed into the "files" directory of your OJS installation. So this
  directory should reside on a disk with sufficient free space.

- RAM: Memory requirements depend a lot on the size of your index. If you have
  several GB of article galley files and you want best search performance then
  you'll need a few GB of RAM for the Solr server and for the operating system's
  file cache, too. Smaller installations require much less memory, though. Try
  starting the embedded server with default settings and only get back to it if
  you experience performance problems. In most cases, default settings will
  probably work for you. If the Java VM runs out of memory then augment the
  corresponding memory parameters in the start script (embedded/bin/start.sh).
  If that doesn't help and you see a lot of swapping occur on your machine then
  you'll probably have to install more physical RAM.

- PHP configuration: The plug-in relies on the PHP curl. Please activate it
  before enabling the plug-in. If you have a large OJS installation then rebuilding
  your index (see the dedicated chapter) may require lots of memory. Please increase
  the 'memory_limit' in php.ini until you no longer get 'Allowed memory size
  ... exhausted' errors.


5 Embedded Server Mode: Installation and Configuration
------------------------------------------------------

As we do not want to unnecessarily blow up our default OJS distribution and want
to make sure that you always install the latest release of Solr, we do not
distribute the Solr/Jetty java binaries with this plug-in. You'll have to
download and install them before you can use the plug-in. This also allows you to run one Solr server
for multiple OJS installations.
The following paragraphs will explain how to do this. This will transform your OJS server into
a Solr search server. If you already installed the Solr server for one of your installations and just want
to install the plugin for another OJS installation you can ommit steps 1) and 3) - 5).

  1) Install java:
     You'll need a working installation of the Java 8 Platform, Standard Edition
     (J2SE) Runtime Environment, Version 1.8 or higher. If you are on Linux then
     install a J2SE compliant Java package. If you are on Windows you may get
     the latest J2SE version from http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp.
  
  2) Install the OJS Lucene Plugin either from the OJS plugin gallery or from https://github.com/ojsde/lucene
  
     If you install the OJS Lucene plugin for an additional OJS installation (i.e. you
     already have a running Solr server) please create a symbolic link to the installation
     of you Solr server:
     
     #> ln -s <path to your OJS installation containg the Solr server installation>/plugins/generic/lucene/lib/solr-8.1.1 solr

  3) Download the Solr binaries:

 	If you are on Linux execute something like (from the OJS application directory):
          #> cd plugins/generic/lucene/lib
          #> wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/8.1.1/solr-8.1.1.zip
          #>  #> unzip solr-8.1.1.zip
          (You may have to install the unzip tool first...)

          This should create a folder solr-8.1.1 in your lib directory. If
          you are on Linux then please create a symlink pointing to this directory,
          e.g.:
          #> ln -s solr-8.1.1 solr

       If you are on Windows then download and unzip the file to the lib folder
       using your favorite browser and zip tool. Then rename the solr-8.1.1 folder to
       "solr" or use the Windows "mklink" tool to create a symlink to the
       unzipped folder, e.g.:
          C:\...\ojs> cd plugins\generic\lucene\lib
          C:\...\lib> mklink /d solr solr-8.1.1

  4) Check your installation:
     We provide a script that finalizes the installation and helps you to make
     sure that you correctly installed Jetty and Solr.

     On Linux please execute (from the OJS directory):
         #> cd plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin
         #> ./chkconfig.sh

     On Windows this would be:
         C:\...\ojs> cd plugins\generic\lucene\embedded\bin
         C:\...\lib> chkconfig.bat

     Make sure that you have the right access rights to execute the scripts. You might have to set them:
     	 #> cd plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin
     	 #> chmod 774 *

     If you get error messages then please return to step 2) and check your
     installation.

  5) Try starting the Solr server for the first time:
     Go to the directory plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin and execute the
     start script there. On Linux this would be (from the OJS application
     directory):
         #> cd plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin
         #> ./start.sh

     To start the Solr server as a user different from root (recommended) use:
	 #> sudo su -p -l <username> -s /bin/bash -c "./start.sh" 

     You should receive the message "Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=XXXX). Happy searching!" and executing:
         #> ps -ef | grep solr
     you should see the java process of your running Solr instance.

     On Windows this becomes:
         C:\...\ojs> cd plugins\generic\lucene\embedded\bin
         C:\...\lib> start.bat

     And to check that Solr is actually running execute:
         C:\...\ojs> wmic process get Caption,CommandLine | findstr solr
     This should show you the java process running Solr.

     This might be a good time to change your admin password if you haven't
     already; see step 3.
     
     Alternatively you can start the Solr server from the Lucene plugin settings page.

  6) Secure your server (IMPORTANT):
     While we tried to make sure that our Solr configuration be secure by
     default, Solr has NOT been designed to be directly exposed to the internet.
     Please make sure that you have a firewall in place that denies public
     access to IP port 8983. If for some reason you do not have a firewall in
     place right now, then make sure you change the default Solr admin password
     immediately.

     In the standard configuration Basic Authentication is used, and configured
     in the file plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/solr81/security.json.
     The standard admin username and password are solr and SolrRocks

     If you want to change to another authentication method, please consult the
     documentation at
     https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_1/authentication-and-authorization-plugins.htm

     One way to change the password once the server is running (i.e. after you
     have completed step 5) is to use curl. To do this, complete step 5 and use
     the following command from the commandline, replacing PLEASE CHANGE with
     the new password:

     Temporarily make security.json writeable:
	#> sudo chmod g+w security.json
     Chnage password:
	#> curl --user solr:SolrRocks http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/security/authentication -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"set-user": {"solr":"PLEASE CHANGE"}}'
     Secure credentials file:
	#> sudo chmod g-w security.json  

     This command will change the file plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/solr81/security.json,
     so if you upload this file again, the password will be reset to SolrRocks

  7) Now open up your web browser and log into your OJS journal manager account.

     Go to "Settings -> Website -> Plugins" and enable the
     "Lucene Search Plugin" (under "Generic Plugins").

     Enter the search endpoint as: http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/ojs/search and provide the admin username and password (see step 6).

  8) Build your lucene index:

     Back to the command line go to the tools directory and execute the script
     to rebuild your index.

     On Linux and from the OJS directory this becomes:
        #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php -d

     You should see output similar to this:
        # LucenePlugin: Clearing index ... done
        # LucenePlugin: Indexing "lucene-test" ... 412 articles indexed
        # LucenePlugin: Indexing "test" ... 536 articles indexed
        # LucenePlugin: Rebuilding dictionaries ... done

     On Windows execute:
         C:\...\ojs> cd tools
         C:\...\tools> php rebuildSearchIndex.php -d

     Please make sure that the output really includes the "LucenePlugin" string.
     Otherwise your plug-in was not correctly activated.

  9) Execute some searches

     Go to your OJS web frontend and test whether searching with Solr works as
     expected.


6 Central Server Mode: Installation and Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------

Solr can be installed and deployed in many different ways and there is no one
best deployment for large OJS providers. You'll have to understand Solr
sufficiently well to be able to install and configure a Solr server before you
should try to use it with OJS.

We assume that you have this prior knowledge and will only describe the steps
specific to the OJS Lucene/Solr plug-in:

  1) Please decide which journals you would like to collocate in which cores and
     make a list of required cores.

  2) Install Jetty and Solr binaries without configuring anything yet. You can
     always use the embedded installation from the plug-in as a guideline but
     you'll have to make your own choices with respect to the directory
     structure and integration of Solr/Jetty with your operating system. If you
     already use tomcat on your server you can deploy Solr without having to
     install Jetty. Your OS distribution may also provide installation packages
     for Solr and Jetty, so use your own judgement to establish a basic
     installation adequate to your server environemnt.

  3) As a configuration baseline you can copy the files in "plugins/generic/
     lucene/embedded/etc" and "plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/solr" to the
     corresponding places in your Jetty and Solr installation, respectively.

     You'll probably have to change paths and security configuration in
     jetty.xml, webdefault.xml and solrconfig.xml.

     In most cases you can leave dih-ojs.xml and schema.xml unchanged. You may
     want to have a look at the analysis and query chains in schema.xml if you
     have specific analysis requirements. Be careful, though, not to change any
     field definitions as this may have unexpected effects and break the OJS/
     Solr indexing protocol unless you also edit dih-ojs.xml.

     Sooner or later you'll probably want to edit the stopword lists and you may
     want to insert synonym lists or exchange the stemmers.

     In any case you'll have to look at the Solr core configuration in solr.xml
     and you'll have to configure the corresponding search handlers in
     security.json.

     You may also want to change the BASIC authentication password in
     realm.properties. But please do not rely on BASIC authentication alone to
     secure your Solr server.

     The start and stop scripts can be adapted to work in your environment.
     If you are using OS packages then these packages probably already provide
     init scripts so that you do not need start/stop scripts at all.

  4) Once you have a working Solr configuration you'll have to enable the Solr
     plug-in in all OJS installations that you want to connect to your Solr
     server. To do so, open up your web browser and log into your OJS journal
     manager account.

     Go to "Journal Manager -> System Plugins -> Generic Plugins" and enable the
     "Lucene Search Plugin".

  5) Go to the plug-in's setting page and enter the URL of the search handler
     corresponding to the core that you want to index the journal handler. These
     are the search handlers you configured in solrconfig.xml.

     Do not forget to change the BASIC HTTP authentication credentials if you
     changed them for your Solr server.

     Finally you'll have to enter an installation ID that is unique within the
     core that you'll index that OJS installation in. If you index journals from
     three different OJS installations in one core then you'll need three
     distinct installation IDs.

  6) Build your lucene index:

     For each installation separately you'll have to drop to the command line,
     go to the tools directory and execute the script to rebuild your index for
     that installation:
        #> cd tools
        #> php rebuildSearchIndex.php -d

     You should see output similar to this:
        # LucenePlugin: Clearing index ... done
        # LucenePlugin: Indexing "lucene-test" ... 412 articles indexed
        # LucenePlugin: Indexing "test" ... 536 articles indexed
        # LucenePlugin: Rebuilding dictionaries ... done

     Please make sure that the output really includes the "LucenePlugin" string.
     Otherwise your plug-in was not correctly activated.

  7) Execute some searches

     Go to the OJS web frontend of each installation and test whether searching
     with Solr works as expected.


7 Troubleshooting
-----------------

If you have trouble INSTALLING or CONFIGURING the Solr server then you may try
the following:

- If you get 'Allowed memory size ... exhausted' errors while doing an index
  rebuild then you have to increase your 'memory_limit' setting in php.ini.
  Doing a huge index rebuild may require considerable memory resources. This
  cannot be fixed easily as it is due to memory leaks in the PHP mysql
  extension used by OJS.

- Check whether your Solr server is really running:

     #> ps -ef | grep solr

  If the server is not running then try the following steps:

  1) Completely delete the folder 'files/lucene'.

  2) Execute the script 'plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin/start.sh'.

  3) Check whether your Solr server is now running.

  4) If your server is running then execute:

     #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php -d

  6) Execute a test search request in OJS.


- Once the server is running, check whether your index contains data. To do so,
  open a browser window and navigate to the URL 'http://localhost:8983/solr/.
  The browser should ask you for the user name and password you
  configured for your Solr web server. Once you entered your credentials, you
  should see a page with information about your SOLR-instance.
  In the left menu, you find a Core-Selector dropdown. After selecting the OJS Core,
  you will find details about the index content. The field 'numDocs' shows how many
  articles have actually been indexed. And the remaining XML can give you an idea
  whether title, abstract, full text, etc. have been correctly indexed.

  If your index is incomplete then try the following steps:

  1) Stop the Solr server executing the script 'plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/
     bin/stop.sh'.

  2) Completely delete the folder 'files/lucene'.

  3) Execute the script 'plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin/start.sh'.

  4) Execute the command:

     #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php -d

  5) Check the index again via the URL 'http://localhost:8983/solr/#/ojs/core-overview'.

  6) Execute a test search request in OJS.

- If your indexing went through but you inly find metadata and no galley content 
  please verify your OJS "Site Access Options". Only public content will be index by Solr. 

- If your index contains data and you still do not get any search results in OJS
  then try deleting your cache.

  You can execute:

     #> rm cache/fc-plugins-lucene-fieldCache.php

  Alternatively you can delete the cache via OJS' administrator tools.

  Now execute another test search request in OJS.

- If you do get search results, but autosuggestion does not work, make sure that
  autosuggestion has been activated in the plugin settings and the dictionaries have
  been build. You can build the dictionaries from the plugin settings page
  or by executing rebuildSearchIndex.php with the -d flag from the Commandline.

- If the previous steps didn't give you a working search index then have a look
  at the file 'files/lucene/solr.log'. This is the log written by the Solr
  server. Sometimes a solution to your problem may be obvious from the error
  messages, e.g. in the case of permission problems or erroneous symlinks. If
  you have difficulties in interpreting error messages in the log then please
  register a bug report at 'https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib#issues' and post the
  most recent error message. This will help OJS developers to resolve your
  problem.

If you get errors when STARTING or STOPPING the solr server (e.g. the server
does not start or stop from the web interface or you cannot stop the server via
scripts):

- Please make sure that you always start/stop the server in the same way: Either
  through shell scripts or through the web interface. Otherwise it may happen
  that you encounter permission problems that have to do with the fact that your
  web server runs under a different user account than your administrative
  login. If you wish to run Solr under a specific account then you should
  never use the web interface as it can only run the Server under the web server
  account. You may want to write init scripts in this case that start the
  process with the user of your choosing.

- More generally, both on Windows and *nix, you'll have difficulties when
  starting Solr from a different user than stopping it (e.g. on Windows from
  an Administrator prompt and then trying to stop from a user prompt).

- If you have permission problems then please make sure that the 'files/lucene'
  directory and all subfolders and files therein are readable and writable by
  the user account that runs Solr. You may have to change permissions if you
  want to start the server differently than before.

If you find that binary files (i.e. galleys or supplementary files) are NOT
being correctly INDEXED:

- Please make sure that the 'base_url' parameter in your OJS directory points
  to the correct URL (without trailing slash).

If search is performing more slowly than anticipated check your custom ranking
settings. If custom ranking is enabled, this will add an overhead to searches
proportional to the size of your index. 


8 Push versus Pull Indexing
---------------------------

Article indexing can be initiated on the client side (push processing) or on the
server side (pull processing). Both options have their strengths and weaknesses.

Advantages of push configuration:

- Indexing can be done on-demand when new documents are added to OJS. This
  guarantees that the index is always up-to-date.

- Simple configuration, works out-of-the-box.


Advantages of pull configuration:

- Pull processing makes the OJS user interface more responsive as no synchronous
  indexing will take place. Marking an article for update is as fast as a single
  database access. This can make a perceivable difference when articles have
  many galleys or supplementary files attached.

- Push processing means that editorial activity during daytime will cause update
  load peaks on the Solr server exactly while it may also experiences higher
  search volume. This load can be quite erratic and fluctuating in larger system
  environments and therefore difficult to balance. In pull mode indexing
  schedules can be configured and co-ordinated on the server side to balance
  document import load on the central search server and keep it to off-hours.

- Pull provides a process that makes it easy to restart indexing after client-
  side outage or other indexing problems. All meta-data retrieved from the
  OJS clients will be saved to a staging area on the file system. Files that
  cannot be successfully indexed will be moved to a special folder where they
  can be checked and corrected manually and then re-submitted to the indexing
  processing chain. A full index rebuild is not required.

- In the case of index corruption, the last known-to-be-good backup can be
  restored and archived meta-data files can then be used to replay changes to
  the index. This means that even in the case of index corruption a full index
  rebuild is not required.


We recommend using the simpler push configuration by default. If you then
start to encounter situations in which pull processing would be an advantage
you can switch to the more complex but also more scalable pull configuration.

To do so you have to:
- edit the configuration file ('plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/etc/pull.conf')
  of the pull processing script on the Solr server (see the inline comments
  there), especially change the Authentification Credentials if you have
  changed them,
- enable pull-processing in the Lucene plugin settings of all OJS clients,
- schedule the pull download script ('plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin/
  pull.sh') on the Solr server, e.g. as a cron job. We recommend scheduling
  this script once or twice a day during off-hours when server load is low.
- schedule the load processing script ('plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/bin/
  load.sh') on the Solr server, e.g. as a cron job. We recommend scheduling
  this script about every 15 minutes. It polls the staging folder and will do
  nothing if no files are staged for load.
- regularly monitor the staging, reject and archive queues on the Solr server.

To test whether your pull processing configuration works in principle you can
execute the following actions in order:

1) Make sure that you edited the configuration file and enabled pull-processing
   in OJS clients as described above.

2) Trigger a full index rebuild on one of your OJS clients (either on the Lucene
   plugin settings page or through the 'tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php' script).

3) Execute the pull.sh script manually on your Solr server. You should see
   output confirming that one or more XML files have been staged for loading.

4) Execute the load.sh script manually on your Solr server. You should see
   output confirming that one or more XML files have been successfully
   processed and archived.

5) If you get rejected files then check your configuration file and if that
   doesn't help look at the file files/lucene/solr.log for some indication
   of what could have gone wrong.


9 Rebuilding your index, dictionaries and/or usage statistics
--------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few maintenance operations that cannot be fully automated
out-of-the-box:

1) If you are using search features like "dictionary-based auto-suggestions" or
   "alternative spelling suggestions", then you have to make sure that the term
   dictionaries used for these features will be synchronized to the index after
   larger index updates or, if you like, on regular intervals, e.g. once a day.
   Updating dictionaries cannot be done automatically after every index update
   as rebuilding dictionaries can be quite costly.

   If you have a central search index shared between several OJS installations
   then you only have to make the dictionary update once for all installations
   from any of the connected OJS clients. Dictionary updates are always global
   operations.

   Dictionary updates have to be scheduled independently of the index update
   mode (pull or push).

2) Under certain circumstances it may happen that your index becomes outdated or
   corrupt. If, for example, you are using push indexing and your Solr server is
   offline while editors make changes to a journal then your Solr index will be
   out of sync afterwards.

   It also may happen that Solr encounters an error while updating its index. In
   that case you'll find an error message in your Solr log. In the embedded
   deployment scenario this log can be found in "files/lucene/solr-java.log".

   If you customize your Solr schema configuration (e.g. to add additional
   languages) then your index needs to be syncronized, too.

   In these cases you'll have to rebuild your search index so that searches can
   be reliably executed again.


There are two possibilities to execute these administrative tasks:

1) On the command line:

   To update your index and dictionaries, execute the 'rebuildSearchIndex'
   script. This script can be used to automate index maintenance. You may want
   to create a cronjob for example that rebuilds dictionaries every night.

   The script has the following usage pattern:

     php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php [options] [journal_path]

   journal_path:

     This is an (optional) journal URL path as configured in OJS. Giving a
     journal path will only re-index articles from that journal. Giving no
     journal path wil re-index all journals of the installation.

   The options are:

     -d     Rebuild dictionaries.
     -b     Update usage statistics (see Ranking by Usage Statistics, above).
     -n     Do not re-index any articles. If this option is given together
            with a journal path then the journal path will be ignored.
     -h     Display usage information.

   Examples:

     To rebuild all journals without rebuilding dictionaries:

       #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php

     To rebuild only the dictionaries:

       #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php -d -n

     To rebuild the dictionaries, refresh usage statistics and re-index
     all journals of an installation:

       #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php -d -b

     To rebuild the index of a single journal without rebuilding dictionaries:

       #> php tools/rebuildSearchIndex.php some-journal-path


   Automated maintenance:

     Of course you can automate maintenance by installing a cron job, e.g.
     to regularly update the dictionary and/or usage statistics.


2) Through the OJS web page:

   Please go to the Lucene plugin settings page and see the administrative
   section there. The page has appropriate inline help.


10 What else do I have to do to keep my index up to date?
---------------------------------------------------------

Once correctly installed and running, the Solr/Lucene plug-in does not require
any further maintenance. Just monitor performance and resource usage of the Solr
server as you would for any other process.


11 Customizing Solr (additional languages, stopwords, etc.)
-----------------------------------------------------------

All Solr configuration files come with inline comments that hint you about what
can be changed and what you better leave alone so as not to interrupt
communication between OJS and Solr.

Common customizations will above all concern the Solr analysis process, e.g.
customizing multi-language support, adding additional stopwords, introducing
synonyms, etc.

The default configuration already comes equipped with support for all OJS
languages when Solr/Lucene supports these. Languages that are not directly
supported by Solr will be treated in a language-agnostic way so that you should
at least get basic search support.

If you want to customize language support (e.g. remove a stemmer, add stopwords,
add synonyms, etc.) then you can do so in the schema file (plugins/generic/
lucene/embedded/solr/conf/schema.xml). Please make sure you understand the Solr
analysis process first. You may want to read:
- https://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters
- https://wiki.apache.org/solr/LanguageAnalysis

Our schema works with dynamic types. There is one field type for each language.
The OJS locale-language assignment is then done with dynamic fields. You find
both, the type definition and the dynamic field definition in the schema.xml
file.

Let's take support for German as an example: First the schema.xml file contains
the type definition:

<!-- German -->
<fieldType name="text_de" class="solr.TextField" positionIncrementGap="100">
  <analyzer>
    ...
  </analyzer>
</fieldType>

Then, further down the schema.xml file you'll find the dynamic field definition
that points to the type definition:

<dynamicField name="*_de_DE" type="text_de" ... />

If you want to customize support for your language then you'll just have to
change the field type definition for your language. To introduce a new locale
you insert a field type definition and a dynamic field. The default import
configuration will deal automatically with new languages.

To add additional stopwords you have to find the stopword list corresponding to
the language you are customizing. You find the default stopword lists in the
folder 'plugins/generic/lucene/embedded/solr81/conf/lang'. You can edit these files
manually and then restart the Solr process. This should be enough to introduce
the new stopwords.

We use a so-called "bigram" approach by default to index Chinese, Taiwanese or
Japanese texts. If you have texts in simplified Chinese only you may want to
try out the following alternative configuration in your schema.xml:

  ...
  <dynamicField name="*_zh_CN" type="text_csimp" indexed="true"  stored="true"
      multiValued="false" />
  ...

To use this filter, see solr/contrib/analysis-extras/README.txt for instructions
on which jars you need to add to solr/lib.

Still another approach to indexing Chinese, Korean or Japanese could be the
following configuration:

  ...
  <fieldType name="text_cjk" class="solr.TextField" positionIncrementGap="100">
    <analyzer>
      <tokenizer class="solr.LowerCaseTokenizerFactory"/>
      <filter class="solr.EdgeNGramFilterFactory" minGramSize="1"
          maxGramSize="2" side="back"/>
    </analyzer>
  </fieldType>
  ...

If you are searching in mixed-language fields (e.g. titles that contain both
English and Chinese versions of the same text) then searching for words with
quotes (e.g. '+China +"中国"') may be helpful to avoid false positives.


12 Subscription-Based Publications
-----------------------------------

In order for the Solr server to gain access to subscription-only content on the
OJS server, its server IP will have to be authorized as an "institutional
subscriber" of the journals to be indexed.

We ensure that subscription checks will be valid in a pull scenario (see the
description of push vs. pull indexing scenarios above). This means that our
"pull" web service for articles will only provide access to subscription-
protected articles if the requesting server can properly authenticate itself
and has been authorized to access all articles.

The IP-based subscription mechanism is exposed to IP-forging attacks. If such an
attack is a realistic risk in your case then you should set up a proxy that
denies all access to the XML webservice endpoint from outside your internal
network.

The pull service endpoint URL is:
- http://www.your-host.com/index.php/index/lucene/pullChangedArticles

If you are using path-based URLs then your endpoint may change accordingly, e.g.
- http://www.your-host.com/index/lucene/pullChangedArticles

You can issue a parameter-less GET request to the given endpoint to check that
you are looking at the right URL. But please do not do this when you are already
productive as changes to articles will only be published once. So if you look
at the pull service manually you'll have to do a full index rebuild afterwards
to make sure that your index is fully up-to-date.

13 Using facets
---------------
Lucene supports faceted search. In faceted search, in addition to the standard set
of search results, we also get facet results, which are lists of subcategories for
certain categories. For example, for the keyword facet, we get a list of relevant
keywords; for the author facet, we get a list of relevant authors; and so on.
In most UIs, when users click one of these subcategories, the search is narrowed,
or drilled down, and a new search limited to this subcategory (e.g., to a specific
keyword or author) is performed.

Faceting can be enabled or disabled for different categories (discipline, keyword,
method/approach, journal, author and publication date) in the plugin settings form.

If relevant facets are found for a search request, a facet block will be displayed
in the sidebar. You can determine the position of the facets block under
'Settings / Website / Appearance' below Sidebar Management. It is recommended to
move the Lucene Faceting Block to the top of the sidebar.
