During the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants who will help prepare the final publication files, known as galleys. For more detailed information, see [Learning OJS 3: Production](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#production).

The Production stage provides three panels to create files ready for publication.

### <a name="production-ready"></a>Production Ready Files

All files selected by the editor for production will appear here. These typically include files that have been prepared during the [Copyediting stage](copyediting). Production assistants will use these files to generate the final publication formats.

### <a name="production-discussions"></a>Production Discussions

Editors and production assistants can use this panel to initiate conversations if there are any details that need to be clarified before the final publication files can be created.

### <a name="publication-formats"></a>Galleys

Editors and production assistants can create galleys and upload a file for each galley. These typically represent separate publication formats, such as PDF and HTML.

### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add production assistants or layout editors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow#participants).

## <a name="publish"></a>Publishing the Submission

Once you are ready to publish the submission, you must schedule it for publication in an issue.

The **Schedule for Publication** button will allow you to select an forthcoming issue, set a publication date, attach licensing permissions, and add page numbers if desired.
